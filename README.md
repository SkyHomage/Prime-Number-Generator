# Prime-Number-Generator
This is a java program that allows the printing of primes. Use the Driver.java program to start the interactive command line tool. 

1 - allows the print of a range of primes [start, end]

2 - test if number is prime

3 - exits


Was thinking about making another class that implements PrimeNumberGenerator. This class will be called something like super generator and it will cache make use of threading, caching, and probably Sieve of Eratosthenes.
